# WDI 2022: Analysis of Global Development Indicators

This project folder contains all the file related to the analysis of the WDI2022.csv dataset, generated on a snapshot of the **World Development Indicators (WDI)** for the year **2022**. It currently contains the data processing and clustering notebooks and will be expanded to include all future tasks, such as predictive modeling and exploratory analyses, related to this same dataset.

## Project Structure

This directory is organized into the following components:

* **`WDI-2022-data-processing/`**:
    * This folder contains the initial data engineering phase.
    * `WDI-2022-data-processing.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook responsible for downloading the raw WDI dataset, selecting relevant indicators, cleaning the data, handling missing values through removal and imputation, and performing manual corrections.
    * `countries_missing_values_map.html`: An interactive choropleth map visualizing the number of missing indicators per country before imputation.
        * **[View Interactive Map](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rafacmasson/global-development-analysis/blob/main/WDI-2022/WDI-2022-data-processing/countries_missing_values_map.html)**

* **`WDI-2022-clustering/`**:
    * This folder contains the machine learning and analysis phase.
    * `WDI-2022-clustering.ipynb`: This notebook loads the cleaned dataset (`WDI2022.csv`), scales the features, and applies two clustering algorithms: K-Means and HDBSCAN. It includes model optimization, profile analysis, and visualization of the results.
    * `kmeans_cluster_map.html` & `hdbscan_cluster_map.html`: Interactive world maps showing the final country clusters for each algorithm.
        * **[View K-Means Map](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rafacmasson/global-development-analysis/blob/main/WDI-2022/WDI-2022-clustering/kmeans_cluster_map.html)**
        * **[View HDBSCAN Map](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rafacmasson/global-development-analysis/blob/main/WDI-2022/WDI-2022-clustering/hdbscan_cluster_map.html)**
    * `kmeans_country_list_by_cluster.txt` & `hdbscan_country_list_by_cluster.txt`: Text files listing the countries belonging to each identified cluster.

* **`WDI2022.csv`**:
    * The final, processed dataset generated by the data processing notebook. This file serves as the input for the clustering analysis. It contains data for 16 selected indicators for the year 2022, with missing values handled.

## Methodology

1.  **Data Processing:** The raw data from the World Bank was filtered to focus on 16 key indicators for the year 2022. Countries with excessive missing data were removed, and remaining gaps were filled using KNN imputation, followed by critical manual adjustments for specific countries.
2.  **Clustering & Analysis:** The processed data was scaled using `StandardScaler`. The optimal number of clusters for K-Means was determined to be 3 using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis. HDBSCAN was also applied to provide a density-based perspective and identify outliers. The resulting clusters from both methods were then analyzed and compared.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the `WDI-2022` directory.
3.  It is recommended to create a virtual environment.
4.  Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5.  Run the notebooks in the following order:
    1.  `WDI-2022-data-processing/WDI-2022-data-processing.ipynb`
    2.  `WDI-2022-clustering/WDI-2022-clustering.ipynb`
